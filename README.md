# Amazon-Sales-Data
This dashboard showcases the data analysis I conducted on Amazon sales data. I sourced the dataset from GitHub, then cleaned and prepared it for this project. My goal was to explore important business insights, such as ways to improve operations or gain a deeper understanding of current performance.

I used Tableau as the visualization tool and Microsoft Excel for data cleaning. Throughout the project, I focused on identifying key KPIs, including profit margin, top-selling items, profit trends over the years, and several others.
